# Data Science Project: Handling Missing Values and Outliers

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on data preprocessing techniques essential for effective data analysis and machine learning. The notebook demonstrates practical approaches to handle missing data, clean datasets, and manage outliers.

## Project Overview

Data preprocessing is a critical step in data science. This notebook covers:

- Handling NULL values effectively.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Dropping irrelevant or unnecessary columns.
- Processing date and time features.
- Identifying and handling outliers.

## Requirements
